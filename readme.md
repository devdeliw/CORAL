# CORAL

**COre** **R**ust **A**rchitecture for **L**inear-algebra â€” *pure Rust BLAS*

Reaching BLAS performance while remaining 100% Rust.

Core Level-1 and Level-2 routines are implemented. Some outperform
[OpenBLAS](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS) and 
[Apple Accelerate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/blas/)
on Apple Silicon. 

Level-3 routines are being written. 

> **Architecture:** Optimized currently for **AArch64 only**.

## Preliminary benchmarks

Early microbenchmarks (contiguous) suggest competitive performance up to 
$n \simeq 2.5 \times 10^3$.  Below are example `GEMM` benchmarks from 
[benches/plots/](benches/plots/). 

*Performed single-threaded on Apple Silicon.* 

### DGEMM

### SGEMM

The transpose GEMM variants are similar. Hence, for `GEMM`, CORAL
on AArch64 is well-comparable to OpenBLAS. However, Apple Accelerate is
*exceptionally* fast for `GEMM/GEMV` routines. It is not included in the above
benchmarks as it masks any comparison between CORAL and OpenBLAS. For some Level
2 routines though, CORAL does outperform both OpenBLAS and Apple Accelerate. 

These benchmarks, along with the transpose variants of `GEMM` are 
also in [benches/plots](benches/plots/).  

*These results are preliminary and subject to change as kernels and packing strategies evolve.*
