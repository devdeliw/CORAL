# CORAL

**CO**mpiled **R**ust **A**lgebra **Library** is a pure-Rust implementation of BLAS routines. 

I am not knowledgable enough *yet* to make it as fast as traditional BLAS libraries, but I hope
to reach about **70â€“80% of their performance**, while making it written entirely in Rust.

Currently, it is optimized only for **AArch64**.
