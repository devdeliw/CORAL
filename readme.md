# rusty-blas

**rusty-blas** is a pure-Rust implementation of BLAS routines. 

I'm not knowledgable enough yet to make it as fast as traditional BLAS libraries, but I hope to reach about **70â€“80% of their performance**, while making it written entirely in Rust.  

Currently, it is optimized only for **NEON AArch64 architectures**.
