# rusty-blas

**rusty-blas** is a pure-Rust implementation of BLAS Level 1–3 routines.  
I'm not knowledgable enough to make it as fast as traditional BLAS libraries, but I hope to reach about **70–80% of their performance**, while making it written entirely in Rust.  

Currently, it is optimized only for **ARM NEON architectures**.
