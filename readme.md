# rusty-blas

**rusty-blas** is a pure-Rust implementation of BLAS Level 1–3 routines.  
It is not meant to be as rigorous or highly tuned as traditional BLAS libraries, but instead aims to reach about **70–80% of their performance**, while being written entirely in Rust.  

Currently, it is optimized only for **ARM NEON architectures**.
